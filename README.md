# edgecomputing
This project is about comparing the performance parameters of edge computing platforms. As an initial work of the project, I implemented  the simulation of edge and cloud computing topologies and evaluated the performance of both in terms of data latency,throughput.
## Getting Started
We focus on the reliability comparison of different topologies through a quantitative study

I Compare the data latency and packet loss of following topologies:

-Edge computing topology

-Cloud computing topology

-Edge plus cloud computing topology

## Installation
Please look at the documentation of NS3 simulator to configure and run the program...

## Additional Information
Please have a look at the topologies.pdf document to get more information about the project
